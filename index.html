                    <p class="lead text-justify">In the last decades, we have experienced a substantial increase in the
                        volume of published scientific articles and related research objects (e.g., data sets, software
                        packages); a trend that is expected to continue. This opens up fundamental challenges including
                        generating large-scale machine-readable representations of scientific knowledge, making
                        scholarly data discoverable and accessible, and designing reliable, comprehensive, and equitable
                        metrics to assess scientific impact.
                        <strong>The main objective of Sci-K is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners from
                            different disciplines to present, educate, and guide research related to scientific
                            knowledge.</strong> Specifically, we foresee three main themes that cover the most important
                        challenges in this field: <i>representation</i>, <i>discoverability</i>, and <i>assessment</i>.

                            <h5 class="card-title text-center">Representation</h5>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">There is an urge for flexible, context-sensitive,
                                fine-grained, and machine-actionable representations of scholarly knowledge that at the
                                same time are structured, interlinked, and semantically rich.
                                Scientific Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) are becoming
                                <span id="representation_dots">...</span><span id="representation_more"> increasingly
                                    popular as infrastructures for representing scholarly knowledge. They are large
                                    networks describing the actors (e.g., authors, organisations), documents (e.g.,
                                    publications, patents), ancillary material (e.g., research data, software),
                                    contextual information (e.g., projects, fundings), and research knowledge (e.g.,
                                    research topics, tasks, technologies) in this space as well as their reciprocal
                                    relationships.
                                    These resources provide substantial benefits to researchers, companies, and
                                    policymakers by powering several data-driven services for navigating, analysing, and
                                    making sense of research dynamics. Some SKGs examples include Microsoft Academic
                                    Graph (MAG), AMiner, Open Academic Graph, ScholarlyData.org, Semantic Scholar, PID
                                    Graph, Open Research Knowledge Graph, OpenCitations, and the OpenAIRE research
                                    graph.
                                    Regarding this aspect, the main challenge is related to the design of ontologies
                                    able to conceptualise scholarly knowledge, model its representation, and enable its
                                    exchange across different SKGs.</span>

                            <h5 class="card-title text-center">Discoverability</h5>
                            <p class="card-text text-justify">It is important that scholarly information is easily
                                findable, discoverable, and visible, so that it can be mined and organised within SKGs.
                                To this end, we need discovery tools able to crawl the Web and identify scholarly data,
                                whether on a publisher’s
                                <span id="discoverability_dots">...</span><span id="discoverability_more">website or
                                    elsewhere – institutional repositories, pre-print servers, open-access repositories,
                                    and others.
                                    This is a particularly challenging endeavour because it requires a deep
                                    understanding of both the scholarly communication landscape and the needs of a
                                    variety of stakeholders: researchers, publishers, funders, and the general public.
                                    Typically, in addition to the journal landing page, a paper's open version, pieces
                                    of software as well as data sets are often shared via alternative channels that are
                                    disconnected from the journal page.
                                    Currently, this is a major obstacle that the community of practitioners is facing
                                    for creating comprehensive knowledge graphs.
                                    In brief, the challenges are related to the discovery and extraction of entities and
                                    concepts, integration of information from heterogeneous sources, identification of
                                    duplicates, finding connections between entities, and identifying conceptual
                                    inconsistencies.

                            <p class="card-text text-justify">Due to the continuous growth in the volume of research
                                output, rigorous approaches for the assessment of research impact are now more valuable
                                than ever.
                                In this context, we urge reliable, comprehensive, and equitable metrics and indicators
                                of the scientific impact
                                <span id="assessment_dots">...</span><span id="assessment_more">and merit of
                                    publications, data sets, research institutions, individual researchers, and other
                                    relevant entities.
                                    Scientific impact refers to the attention a research work receives inside its
                                    respective and related disciplines, the social/mass media, etc.
                                    Scientific merit, on the other hand, relates to the quality aspects of a work, such
                                    as its novelty, reproducibility, FAIR-ness, and readability.
                                    Nowadays, due to the growing popularity of Open Science initiatives, a large number
                                    of useful science-related data sets have been made openly available, paving the way
                                    for the synthesis of more sophisticated indicators of scientific impact and merit
                                    and, consequently, more rigorous research assessment. For instance, in recent years,
                                    we observed a surge of large SKGs, which providevery rich and relatively clean
                                    sources of information about academics, their publications and relevant metadata.
                                    These SKGs can be used for the development of novel research assessment approaches.

                Towards smart manufacturing and industrial upgrading, various kinds of engineering software and digitalized equipment are widely applied throughout the lifecycle of industrial products. These systems use intelligent sensory devices to add multimedia information to people's perceived reality through sights (e.g. spot lenses on the retina), sounds (headphones), or touch (gloves). As a result, massive multimedia data of different types are being produced. Making full use of these multimedia data can provide real-time information to improve workflow and decision-making.

                The proposed Workshop will focus on the different aspects of industry multimedia computing and measurements with advanced artificial intelligence models, i.e., deep learning, natural language processing, semantic analysis, and pattern recognition. It provides an opportunity for input from multimedia computing-oriented researchers and those from the industry. To the best of our knowledge, this topic has not yet been the central focus of any of the ACM MM workshops. The particular scope of the suggested workshop falls well within the scope of the ACM MM 2023 and would benefit its reader audience. The reputation and popularity of the ACMM MM conference will definitely contribute to the synergy between this and adjacent or complementary fields.

                                    software packages); a trend that is expected to continue. This opens up fundamental
                                    challenges including generating large-scale machine-readable representations of
                                    scientific knowledge, making scholarly data discoverable and accessible, and
                                    designing reliable, comprehensive, and equitable metrics to assess scientific
                                    impact. <b>The main objective of Sci-K is to provide a forum for researchers and
                                        practitioners from different disciplines to present, educate, and guide research
                                        related to scientific knowledge.</b> Specifically, we foresee three main themes
                                    that cover the most important challenges in this field: representation,
                                    discoverability, and assessment.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <i>Representation</i>. There is an urge for flexible, context-sensitive,
                                    fine-grained, and machine-actionable representations of scholarly knowledge that at
                                    the same time are structured, interlinked, and semantically rich: Scientific
                                    Knowledge Graphs (SKGs). These resources can power several data-driven services for
                                    navigating, analysing, and making sense of research dynamics. Current challenges are
                                    related to the design of ontologies able to conceptualise scholarly knowledge, model
                                    its representation, and enable its exchange across different SKGs.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <i>Discoverability</i>. It is important that scholarly information is easily
                                    findable, discoverable, and visible, so that it can be mined and organised within
                                    SKGs. Hence, we need discovery tools able to crawl the Web and identify scholarly
                                    data, whether on a publisher’s website or elsewhere – institutional repositories,
                                    preprint servers, open-access repositories, and others. This is a particularly
                                    challenging endeavour as it requires a deep understanding of both the scholarly
                                    communication landscape and the needs of a variety of stakeholders: researchers,
                                    publishers, funders, and the general public. Other challenges are related to the
                                    discovery and extraction of entities and concepts, integration of information from
                                    heterogeneous sources, identification of duplicates, finding connections between
                                    entities, and identifying conceptual inconsistencies.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <i>Assessment</i>. Due to the continuous growth in the volume of research output,
                                    rigorous approaches for the assessment of research impact are now more valuable than
                                    ever. In this context, we urge reliable, comprehensive, and equitable metrics and
                                    indicators of the scientific impact and merit of publications, datasets, research
                                    institutions, individual researchers, and other relevant entities.
                                </p>

                                    The workshop calls for full research papers (up to <span style="color:red">8 pages +
                                        2 pages of appendices + 2 pages of references</span>), describing original work
                                    on the listed topics, and short papers (up to <span style="color:red">4 pages + 2
